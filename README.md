# NEON

Neon themed javascript problem :)

## The Problem

We are opening a food stall and we need a NEON sign to attract customers.

Our product people came up with a few requirements that should do the trick:

- upper case letters
- an emoji on each end
- the sign should light up from top to bottom, one section every half a second
We also decided to use the `neon.js` framework to do some of the heavy lifting.

Unfortunately they haven't decided on what type of food we will be selling so we need to keep it flexible.

Example:
```
displaySign('🍕','pizza');
┏──┓
│🍕│
│P │
│ I│
│Z │
│ Z│
│A │
│🍕│
┗──┛
```

## Start

Edit this file [index.js](index.js) by adding the required code in the `// ...` comment blocks.

To run open the terminal and use this command:

```
npm run start
```
