# NEON

Neon themed javascript problem :)

## The Problem

We need a function that outputs a neon sign given an emoji and string,
the sign need to have upper case letters and the emoji on each end,
it needs to light up from top to bottom, one section every half a second,
a library is provided to produce formatted neon sections.

Example:
```
┏──┓
│🍕│
│P │
│ I│
│Z │
│ Z│
│A │
│🍕│
┗──┛
```

## Start
